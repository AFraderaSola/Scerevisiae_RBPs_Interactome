# 02_ProteinProtein_Interactions

This **sub-folder** contains all the scripts from the **PPI** group. 

Within this folder you can find the data and scripts to generate the following figures:

- Figure 2C

- Figure 6A

It is organized in **XXX sub-folders**, usually an **Input** and **Output** folder for each script (the prefix number of the folders matches the one of the scripts)

## 00_IPsResultsFiles

This **sub-folder** contains the **quantified proteins** and the **enriched proteins** for the **PPI** and **RDI** groups for each YAFXXX strain.

## 01_InputFiles

This **sub-folder** contains the input files from the **01_Interactors_SGDandCensus.R** script.

## 01_OutputFiles

This **sub-folder** contains the output files from the **01_Interactors_SGDandCensus.R** script, including **Figure 2C**.

## 01_Interactors_SGDandCensus.R

This script summarizes the enriched proteins for the **PPI** group in each YAFXX strain and creates a **bar plot** showing their **inclusion** at **BioGRID** and the **RBP census**. With this script, you can generate the following figures:

- Figure 2C
