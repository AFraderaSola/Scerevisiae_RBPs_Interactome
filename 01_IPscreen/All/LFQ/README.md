# All

This **sub-folder** contains a downstream analysis **including all strains**. The **input files** needed for those analysis are generated on each RBP-bait sub-folder (**YAFXXX**). The scripts to generate the previously mentioned figures are inside this folder. More details on the scripts and how to run them inside this folder.

It is organized in **three sub-folders**.

## 01_Both
