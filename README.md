# Scerevisiae_RBPs_Interactome

Code and data for the *S. cerevisiae* RBP interactome project. Data from this project is published under the following title:

**"RNA-dependent interactome allows network-based assignment of RBP functionality"**
  
Within this repository, the code to generate all the analysis and figures on the paper 
is provided.

The repository is structured in three main folders. Each folder contains its analysis scripts, ordered in a numeric fashion. Finally, for each script, there is a sub-folder for the input (when needed) and output files, matching the script number.

## 00_Candidates folder

This folder contains scripts that analyze and describe the characteristics of our candidates. Within this folder you can find the scripts to generate the following figures:

- Supplementary Figure 1

- Supplementary Figure 4C
